Review of For Loops and Nested For Loops

The for loop performs statements a certain number of times.  Recall that a for loop is really a while loop but has a specialized syntax.  

```
    for(initialization; test; update) {
      statement(s); 
    }
```
- The intialization is to declare what variable to use in the loop.  This is performed once as the loop begins.  By convention, i (or j, k) is used as the name of this variable but it can be named whatever we want it to be.  
- The test compares the value of the variable against a limit, which is why we used a comparison operator.  
- If the test passes, the update increases or decreases the variable value by a certain amount.

We can use for loops to iterate through a String, an array, have it count with a given pattern, etc.
